# Rack::Builder â†’ rackup

# As I mentioned above, rackup converts the supplied rack config file to an instance of Rack::Builder. This is how is happens under the hood ( just so you get an idea ) :
### config_file = File.read(config)
### rack_application = eval("Rack::Builder.new { #{config_file} }")

# And then rackup supplies rack_application to the respective webserver :
### server.run rack_application, options

# In short, rack config files are evaluated within the context of a Rack::Builder object. 
# So if we convert infinity to a rack config file which rackup can understand, we are done.
